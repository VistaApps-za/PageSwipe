## Full Description

### The Problem

You finish a great book. Now what? Goodreads recommendations feel random. Amazon just pushes bestsellers. And that shelf of 200+ books at home? You've accidentally bought duplicates at the bookstore more times than you'd admit.

### The Solution

**PageSwipe makes book discovery actually fun.**

Swipe through curated book cards like you're on a dating app. Right for "interested," left for "not for me." Our algorithm learns your taste with every swipe—not just genres, but authors, page counts, and themes you gravitate toward.

**But we didn't stop there.**

- **RapidScan** — Point your camera at your bookshelf and scan. No confirmations, no dialogs. Just scan-scan-scan. Catalog 100 books in 10 minutes.
- **Bookstore Mode** — At a bookstore? Scan any book to instantly check: "Do I already own this?"
- **Smart Lists** — Track what you're reading, what you want to read, and create custom collections.
- **Book Clubs** — Create or join clubs. Vote on the next read. See what friends are into.

### Why PageSwipe?

- **Cross-platform** — iPhone, iPad, and web. Your library syncs everywhere.
- **Privacy-first** — Your reading data stays yours. No selling to advertisers.
- **Works, not editions** — We group all editions together. No more duplicate entries for paperback vs hardcover.

### Free vs Pro

| Feature | Free | Pro |
|---------|------|-----|

## Maker's First Comment

Hey Product Hunt!

I built PageSwipe because I was tired of the "what should I read next?" paralysis.

Goodreads felt like homework. Amazon recommendations were just ads. And my physical bookshelf? Complete chaos—I'd buy books I already owned way too often.

So I built what I actually wanted:

1. **Fun discovery** — Swiping through books is oddly satisfying. And it actually works—the more you swipe, the better recommendations get.

2. **My Library** — RapidScan was a game-changer for me. I cataloged 300+ books in about 30 minutes. Now I can search "Wilbur Smith" at the bookstore and instantly see which ones I own.

3. **Simplicity** — No social pressure, no "reading challenges," no guilt. Just books you love.

The web app is free to try right now. iOS app is on the App Store.

I'd love your feedback—what features would make this your go-to book app?

Happy reading!

Just launched PageSwipe on Product Hunt!

Tinder for books. Swipe to discover reads you'll love.

Plus: RapidScan lets you catalog your entire home library in minutes.

Link in bio. Would love your support!

**Tweet 2:**
The problem: You finish a book and have no idea what to read next.

Goodreads = overwhelming
Amazon = just ads
Friends = different taste

PageSwipe learns YOUR taste with every swipe.

**Tweet 3:**
My favorite feature: RapidScan

Point camera at bookshelf. Scan. Scan. Scan.

No confirmations. No dialogs. Just fast.

I cataloged 300 books in 30 minutes.

**Tweet 4:**
Now when I'm at a bookstore, I just scan any book.

Instantly know: "Do I already own this?"

No more accidental duplicates.

### LinkedIn Post

Excited to share something I've been working on: PageSwipe

It's a book discovery app that actually understands your taste.

Swipe right on books you're interested in. Left on ones you're not. The algorithm learns and gets smarter.

But the feature I'm most proud of is RapidScan — point your phone at your bookshelf and scan barcodes continuously. No confirmations needed. I cataloged my entire 300+ book collection in about 30 minutes.

Now when I'm browsing at a bookstore, I can instantly check if I already own something.

We're live on Product Hunt today. Would love your support and feedback.
